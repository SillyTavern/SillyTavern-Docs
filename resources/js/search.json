Our goal is to empower users with as much utility and control over their LLM prompts as possible, embracing the steep learning curve as part of the fun.","SillyTavern is a passion project brought to you by a dedicated community of LLM enthusiasts and will always be free and open-sourced. Beginning in February 2023 as a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8, SillyTavern now has over 100 contributors and 2 years of independent development under its belt, and continues to serve as a leading software for savvy AI hobbyists."]},{"l":"Screenshots","p":["API Connection","Chat UI","Advanced Formatting","World Info"]},{"l":"Installation Requirements","p":["The hardware requirements are minimal: it will run on anything that can run NodeJS 18 or higher.

The content of a character card can be anything: an abstract scenario, an assistant tailored for a specific task, a famous personality or a fictional character.","The name field is the only required character card input. To start a neutral conversation with the language model, create a new card simply called \"Assistant\" and leave the rest of the boxes blank. For a more themed chat, you can provide the language model with various background details, behavior and writing patterns, and a scenario to jump start the chat.","To have a quick conversation without selecting a character card or to just test the LLM connection, simply type your prompt input into the input bar on the Welcome Screen after opening SillyTavern.

More than you will ever have.","It is possible to reduce VRAM requirements by compressing the model using quantization techniques, such as GPTQ or AWQ. This makes the model somewhat less capable, but greatly reduces the VRAM requirements to run it. Suddenly, this allowed people with gaming GPUs like a 3080 to run a 13B model. Even though it's not as good as the unquantized model, it's still good.","It gets better: there also exists a model format and quantization called GGUF (previously GGML) which has become the format of choice for normal people without monster GPUs. This allows you to use an LLM without a GPU at all. It will only use CPU and RAM. This is much slower (probably 15 times) than running the LLM on a GPU using GPTQ/AWQ, especially during the prompt processing, but the model's ability is just as good. The GGUF creator then optimized GGUF further by adding a configuration option that allows people with a gaming-grade GPU to offload parts of the model to the GPU, allowing them to run part of the model at GPU speed (note that this doesn't reduce RAM requirements, it only improves your generation speed).","There are different sizes of models, named based on the number of parameters they were trained with. You will see names like 7B, 13B, 30B, 70B, etc. You can think of these as the brain size of the model. A 13B model will be more capable than the 7B from the same family of models: they were trained on the same data, but the bigger brain can retain the knowledge better and think more coherently. Bigger models also require more VRAM/RAM.","There are several degrees of quantization (8-bit, 5-bit, 4-bit, etc). The lower you go, the more the model degrades, but the lower the hardware requirements. So even on bad hardware, you might be able to run a 4-bit version of your desired model. There's even 3-bit and 2-bit quantization but at this point, you're beating a dead horse. There's also a further quantization subtypes named k_s, k_m, k_l, etc. k_m is better than k_s but requires more resources.","The context size (how long your conversation can become without the model dropping parts of it) also affects VRAM/RAM requirements. Thankfully, this is a configurable setting, allowing you to use a smaller context to reduce VRAM/RAM requirements. (Note: the context size of Llama2-based models is 4k. Mistral is advertised as 8k, but it's 4k in practice.)","Sometime in 2023, NVIDIA changed their GPU driver so that if you need more VRAM than your GPU has, instead of the task crashing, it will begin using regular RAM as a fallback. This will ruin the writing speed of the LLM, but the model will still work and give the same quality of output. Thankfully, this behavior can be disabled.","Given all of the above, the hardware requirements and performance vary completely depending on the family of model, the type of model, the size of the model, the quantization method, etc."]},{"l":"Model size calculator","p":["You can use Nyx's Model Size Calculator to determine how much RAM/VRAM you need.","Remember, you want to run the largest, least quantized model that can fit in your memory, i.e. without causing disk swapping."]},{"l":"Downloading an LLM","p":["To get started, you will need to download an LLM.

It's a flexible general-purpose prompt that works well for many situations, because it establishes that the AI is writing as a character in a conversation with your persona.","However, you can adjust the main prompt to better suit your needs. Here are some common reasons to adjust the main prompt:","Provide additional instructions: for example, you want the AI to explain its reasoning, follow specific rules, or avoid certain topics","Clarify the role of the AI: for example, you want the AI to act as a narrator, a storyteller, or a guide","Change the context of the conversation: for example, you want the AI to respond as if it were an AI assistant, text adventure game, or a writing partner","All the examples in this guide have worked well for other users, but the prompt that works for your needs and the model you're using might be different. Experiment with different instructions and prompting styles to see what works best for you.

For example, if you want the AI to avoid writing in a certain way, it's better to tell it how you want it to write instead. And while \"Do not decide what {{user}} says or does\" is commonly included in prompts to prevent the AI from controlling your persona, some users find \"Write {{char}}'s responses in a way that respects {{user}}'s autonomy\" is more effective.","There is often a better place than the Main Prompt to include information about the user or characters, modify a character's writing and speaking style, or give other specific instructions.

In terms of writing style and word choice, the AI assumes that all the messages in history were generated according to the rules in the current main prompt, and that it should continue to generate messages in the same way. Some suggestions for dealing with this are:","insert current instructions close to or after the end of message history, for example by using an Author's Note","test your changes to the main prompt by starting a new conversation","edit the message history to remove or correct examples of unwanted behaviour","use the Post-History Instructions to provide final instructions to the AI","Never let the AI \"get away\" with something you don't want it to do.

It temporarily shuffles the most relevant messages to the beginning or end of the chat history. This happens when the model's reply to your last message is generated.","The messages at the start and end of the chat history tend to have the greatest impact on the model's reply. Therefore, shuffling relevant messages to these locations can help the model focus on relevant information in its reply.","In particular, chat vectorization can find relevant messages that are too far back in the message history to fit into the request context. Shuffling these messages into context provides the model with information that it would not have otherwise.","Chat vectorization is a kind of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Retrieval-augmented generation increases the quality of responses generated by a model, by providing additional relevant information in the prompt.","Retrieval: the most recent messages are used to retrieve relevant past messages","Augmented: the model's context is augmented by inserting past messages in a useful way","Generation: the model is instructed to use the past messages when generating the response","A vector is a set of numbers that could represent the themes, content, style, or other characteristics of a piece of text.","Vectorization is calculating the vector that represents a piece of text. This is done by a vectorizing model. Just as text generation models make text from text, vectorizing models make vectors from text.","Vector search finds relevant results by comparing vectors rather than, say, keywords. If we calculate the vector for a search query, we can compare it to the stored vectors for a collection of pieces of text. This finds the texts in our collection that are most similar to the text in the search query. In the case of chat vectorization, the\"search query\" is the most recent 2 messages, and the \"texts in our collection\" are all the other messages in the chat."]},{"l":"Setting up","p":["To enable Chat vectorization, select \"Extensions\" > \"Vector Storage\" > \"Enabled for chat messages\".","Configure a vectorization source and vectorization model.

Sometimes, text may appear with only a single asterisk, and AI models may vary their formatting mid-conversation. For example, they might use asterisks initially and then switch to unmarked text. A properly formatted line should look like this:","Hey! I'm so excited to finally meet you. I've heard so many great things about you and I'm eager to pick your brain about computers.* She walked across the room and picked up her cup of coffee*","Most narrator/character systems switch voices upon encountering an asterisk or quotation marks, which is somewhat effective.

While some irregularities and AI deviations in message formatting are inevitable, any line beginning or ending with an asterisk should now be recognized as Narrator dialogue. Lines enclosed in double quotes are identified as Character dialogue.
