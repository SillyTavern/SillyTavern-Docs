Our goal is to empower users with as much utility and control over their LLM prompts as possible, embracing the steep learning curve as part of the fun.","SillyTavern is a passion project brought to you by a dedicated community of LLM enthusiasts and will always be free and open-sourced. Beginning in February 2023 as a fork of TavernAI 1.2.8, SillyTavern now has over 200 contributors and 2 years of independent development under its belt, and continues to serve as a leading software for savvy AI hobbyists."]},{"l":"Screenshots","p":["API Connection","Chat UI","Advanced Formatting","World Info"]},{"l":"Installation Requirements","p":["The hardware requirements are minimal: it will run on anything that can run NodeJS 18 or higher.

The content of a character card can be anything: an abstract scenario, an assistant tailored for a specific task, a famous personality or a fictional character.","The name field is the only required character card input. To start a neutral conversation with the language model, create a new card simply called \"Assistant\" and leave the rest of the boxes blank. For a more themed chat, you can provide the language model with various background details, behavior and writing patterns, and a scenario to jump start the chat.","To have a quick conversation without selecting a character card or to just test the LLM connection, simply type your prompt input into the input bar on the Welcome Screen after opening SillyTavern.

Read it before bothering people with tech support questions."]},{"i":"what-are-the-best-large-language-models","l":"What are the best Large Language Models?","p":["It is impossible to answer this question as there's no standardized scale of \"Best\". The community has enough resources and discussions going on Reddit and Discord to form at least some opinion on what is the preferred / go-to model. Your mileage may vary."]},{"i":"what-is-the-best-configuration","l":"What is the best configuration?","p":["If there was a best or no-brainer setup, would there even have to be a need for configuration? The best configuration is the one that works for you. It's a trial-and-error process."]},{"l":"Hardware requirements and orientation","p":["This is a complex subject, so I'll stick to the essentials and generalize.","There are thousands of free LLMs you can download from the Internet, similar to how Stable Diffusion has tons of models you can get to generate images.","Running an unmodified LLM requires a monster GPU with a ton of VRAM (GPU memory). More than you will ever have.","It is possible to reduce VRAM requirements by compressing the model using quantization techniques, such as GPTQ or AWQ. This makes the model somewhat less capable, but greatly reduces the VRAM requirements to run it. Suddenly, this allowed people with gaming GPUs like a 3080 to run a 13B model. Even though it's not as good as the unquantized model, it's still good.","It gets better: there also exists a model format and quantization called GGUF (previously GGML) which has become the format of choice for normal people without monster GPUs. This allows you to use an LLM without a GPU at all. It will only use CPU and RAM. This is much slower (probably 15 times) than running the LLM on a GPU using GPTQ/AWQ, especially during the prompt processing, but the model's ability is just as good. The GGUF creator then optimized GGUF further by adding a configuration option that allows people with a gaming-grade GPU to offload parts of the model to the GPU, allowing them to run part of the model at GPU speed (note that this doesn't reduce RAM requirements, it only improves your generation speed).","There are different sizes of models, named based on the number of parameters they were trained with. You will see names like 7B, 13B, 30B, 70B, etc. You can think of these as the brain size of the model. A 13B model will be more capable than the 7B from the same family of models: they were trained on the same data, but the bigger brain can retain the knowledge better and think more coherently. Bigger models also require more VRAM/RAM.","There are several degrees of quantization (8-bit, 5-bit, 4-bit, etc). The lower you go, the more the model degrades, but the lower the hardware requirements. So even on bad hardware, you might be able to run a 4-bit version of your desired model. There's even 3-bit and 2-bit quantization but at this point, you're beating a dead horse. There's also a further quantization subtypes named k_s, k_m, k_l, etc. k_m is better than k_s but requires more resources.","The context size (how long your conversation can become without the model dropping parts of it) also affects VRAM/RAM requirements. Thankfully, this is a configurable setting, allowing you to use a smaller context to reduce VRAM/RAM requirements. (Note: the context size of Llama2-based models is 4k. Mistral is advertised as 8k, but it's 4k in practice.)","Sometime in 2023, NVIDIA changed their GPU driver so that if you need more VRAM than your GPU has, instead of the task crashing, it will begin using regular RAM as a fallback. This will ruin the writing speed of the LLM, but the model will still work and give the same quality of output. Thankfully, this behavior can be disabled.","Given all of the above, the hardware requirements and performance vary completely depending on the family of model, the type of model, the size of the model, the quantization method, etc."]},{"l":"Model size calculator","p":["You can use Nyx's Model Size Calculator to determine how much RAM/VRAM you need.","Remember, you want to run the largest, least quantized model that can fit in your memory, i.e. without causing disk swapping."]},{"l":"Downloading an LLM","p":["To get started, you will need to download an LLM.

If you don't want GGUF, he links the original model page where you might find other formats for that same model.","On a given model's page, you will find a whole bunch of files.","You might not need all of them! For GGUF, you just need the .gguf model file (usually 4-11GB). If you find multiple large files, it's usually all different quantizations of the same model, you only need to pick one.","For .safetensors files (which can be GPTQ or AWQ or HF quantized or unquantized), if you see a number sequence in the filename like model-00001-of-00003.safetensors, then you need all 3 of those .safetensors files + all the other files in the repository (tokenizer, configs, etc.) to get the full model.","As of January 2024, Mixtral MOE 8x7B is widely considered the state of the art for local LLMs. If you have the 32GB of RAM to run it, definitely try it.

NovelAI's models are built purely around text completion: instead of taking your input as a message and formulating a response, NAI's models attempt to continue the incoming prompt.

She's short and petite, with long white hair that fades into a green gradient in her braided side ponytail, and emerald green eyes shaped like crosses.[...]\" No, really, that's it. Just write out, in normal sentences, what the character looks like, acts like, etc., and the AI will pick up on it.","If you don't trust your writing abilities or want a more structured way to go about it, you can use the attributes method, which is present in the NovelAI training data. This works as a simple list of character traits of different types. Here's a list of possible attributes that have been tested to be effective with NovelAI's models:","\"Type: character\" is there to tell the AI that this is describing a character (as opposed to a location, object, or other type of thing). The rest of the attributes are optional, and some are redundant (for example, Personality, Mind, and Mental all mean basically the same thing), but these have been tested and work well with NovelAI's models.

This is helpful to avoid unintended chains of activations.","Delay until recursion: This entry will only be activated during recursive checks, meaning it won't be triggered in the initial pass but can be activated by other entries that have recursion enabled. Now, with the added Recursion Level for those delays, entries are grouped by levels. Initially, only the first level (smallest number) will match. Once no matches are found, the next level becomes eligible for matching, repeating the process until all levels are checked.

Just as text generation models make text from text, vectorizing models make vectors from text.","Vector search finds relevant results by comparing vectors rather than, say, keywords. If we calculate the vector for a search query, we can compare it to the stored vectors for a collection of pieces of text.

This is used as an override to prevent the script from running when you simply don't want to change any of the script's settings and/or don't want to disable it entirely via the switch on the script list (as doing so would prevent slash commands from triggering it).","'Don't Substitute' will cause any SillyTavern macros to be ignored so the RegEx script will treat them literally when searching.","'Escaped' will add a RegEx escape slash \\ before each character to ensure they do not accidentally alter the overall RegEx sequence. This can be useful if you have certain special characters in the values of the macro.","'Raw' will send in the value of the macro verbatim. This might alter the way your RegEx script searches the text if the value of the macro contains certain special characters.","'Reasoning': script will be run against the contents of the 'reasoning' object returned by Chat Completion API's like Gemini or Deepseek. If 'Alter Outgoing Prompt' is checked under Ephemerality, the script will also be applied to any reasoning blocks that are added into prompt in subsequent chat turns.","'Run on Edit' makes the script also run after a chat message has been edited.

This is commonly used to apply styles to specific words. Going back to the above example, if **{{match}}** were put into the 'Replace With' box instead, all occurences of the word 'apple' would be replaced with **apple**, which would apply the bold markdown style to it.","Affects: This list of checkboxes defines the text sources to which the RegEx script will be applied.","Find Regex: This is the Regular Expression that is used to detect your targeted text pattern. This is usually the most complex part of any RegEx script, and is the easiest place to make mistakes. Refer to the links at the top of the page for information how to write a RegEx sequence.

In a very simple example, if your 'Find Regex' is apple, and your 'Replace With' is orange, all instances of 'apple' would be automatically changed to 'orange' in any text where the script is applied.","Test Mode: This will open a comparison view at the top of the editor. Type some text into the 'Input' box, and the results of your RegEx script will be shown in the Output box. It is a valuable debug tool as it will update the Output box in real time as you make changes to the script settings.","Trim Out: text put in this box will be removed from the matched text sequence before the 'Replace With' process is applied. For example, if our match was 'apple', and the Trim Out box contains 'le', then the letters 'le' would be removed first before the 'Replace With' process is applied. Since our 'Replace With' box contains **{{match}}** it would result in **app** being put in as the replacement for 'apple' (first 'le' is removed, and the remaining matched text is given the bold markdown style). Multiple trims can be applied by adding a newline between each string you want to remove.","Variables such as $1, $2, $3 etc can be used to insert what are called 'Capture Groups'. These are substrings located in the text sequence matched by the 'Find Regex' sequence.

Not every backend supports simultaneous requests, so switch to blocking mode if summarization fails.","Classic, blocking.

The Raw prompt builder always omits WI/AN.","Update every X messages- sets the interval at which the summary is generated. 0 means that the automatic summarization is disabled, but you can still trigger it manually by clicking the \"Summarize now\" button. This should be adjusted based on how quickly the prompt buffer entirely fills with chat messages. Ideally, you'd want to have the first summary generated when the messages are starting to get dropped out of the prompt.","Update every X words- same as above, but using words (not tokens!) instead of messages, theoretically can be a more accurate measurement due to how unpredictable the contents of chat messages usually are, but your mileage may vary.","If both \"Update every\" sliders are set to a non-zero value, then both will trigger summary updates at their respective intervals, depending on what happens first.
