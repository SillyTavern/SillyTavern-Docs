Once AllTalk is loaded, select it within SillyTavern on the TTS page, ensuring to select the correct AllTalk server version in the settings.

- **Settings Management**: AllTalk may enable or disable specific settings based on your selected configuration.

- **Performance Optimization**: Enable DeepSpeed and Low VRAM modes selectively to improve performance based on system resources.
- **Narrator function**: Details of the Narrator function can be found on the [AllTalk Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki/Narrator-Function).

Full details of the SillyTavern AllTalk Extension will be updated on the [AllTalk Wiki page for SillyTavern](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki/SillyTavern-Extension)

TGWUI Users who user the AllTalk extension for TGWUI need to disable `Enable TGWUI TTS` in the TGWUI chat interface, otherwise you will have duplicate TTS audio generated.
