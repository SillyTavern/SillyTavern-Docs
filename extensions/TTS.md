# TTS

SillyTavern has a wide range of TTS options. This page explains the setup and use.

### What is it?

TTS is used to have a voice narrate parts of your chat.

### Configuring TTS

#### TTS Provider Selectbox

Used to select which TTS service you want to use.

- **ElevenLabs** - paid subscription required, highest quality voices available at present.
- **Silero** - free, runs on your PC, quality can vary widely
- **System** - uses your OS TTS engine, if one exists. Quality can vary widely depending on the OS.
- **Edge** - free, runs via Azure, generally quite fast, and voices feel natural but dry and emotionless. Like listening to the evening news or a radio announcer. When running with "Plugin" selected as the provider, you also need to install [this server plugin](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern-EdgeTTS-Plugin), otherwise the TTS won't work.
- **Coqui-TTS** - free, No API Implementation at this time. High-performance Text2Speech models (Tacotron, Tacotron2, Glow-TTS, SpeedySpeech) as well as Bark.
- **Novel** - requires a paid NovelAI subscription, generated by NovelAI's TTS engine
- **RVC** - free, voice cloning
- **Kokoro** - free, uses [kokoro.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kokoro-js) to run the model locally in your browser. However, [some browsers](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) may not support WebGPU for the device option.
- **Electron Hub** - reuses your Electron Hub API key to access cloud voices (GPT-4o Mini TTS, Microsoft neural voices, etc.) with per-model controls.

#### Checkboxes

- **Enabled** - turns TTS playback on/off
- **Auto Generation** - lets TTS start playing automatically when a new message enters the chat
- **Only narrate "quotes"** - Limits TTS playback to only include text within `"quotation marks"`. This will `*include "quotes" within asterisk lines*` (internal variable name = `narrate_quoted_only`)
- **Ignore \*text, even "quotes", inside asterisks\*** - TTS will not play any text within `*asterisks*`, even "quotes" (internal variable name = `narrate_dialogues_only`)
- *having both "only narrate quotes" and "ignore asterisks" checkboxes both checked will result in the TTS only reading "quotes" which are not in asterisks, and ignoring everything else.*
- **Narrate only the translated text** - this will make the TTS only narrate the translated text.

Given the example text: `*Cohee approaches you with a faint "nya"* "Good evening, senpai", she says.`
Here's a table showing how the text will be modified based on the boolean states of **Ignore \*text, even "quotes", inside asterisks\*** and **Only narrate "quotes"**:

| **Ignore \*text, even "quotes", inside asterisks\*** 	 | **Only narrate "quotes"**	 | **Output**                                                                |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Disabled                                               | 	Disabled	                 | Cohee approaches you with a faint "nya" "Good evening, senpai", she says. |
| Disabled                                               | Enabled	                   | "nya"... "Good evening, senpai"                                           |
| Enabled	                                               | Disabled	                  | "Good evening, senpai", she says.                                         |
| Enabled	                                               | Enabled	                   | "Good evening, senpai"                                                    |

#### Sliders

These will change depending on the API you select.

(explanation coming soon)

#### Buttons

- **Apply** - this must be clicked after setting a TTS API and after editing the voice map.
- **Available voices** - loads a popup with all voices available for your selected API, and lets you preview them with sample dialogues.

### Electron Hub

Electron Hub's unified TTS endpoint adapts its controls to the voice model you choose:

- The provider button in the corner links to the shared API key manager—no need to paste the key twice.
- Speed (0.25×–4×), temperature, and optional top-p apply to every voice.
- GPT-4o Mini exposes an **Instructions** textbox for style guidance (for example, `Speak cheerfully and energetically`).
- **Dia** voices add fields for a reference transcript plus CFG scale and top-k ranges.
- Microsoft neural voices unlock speech rate, pitch adjustment, and an emotional style hint.
- Some voices may surface additional vendor-specific parameters in a dynamic panel beneath the main controls.

Remember to click **Apply** after tweaking any settings so the changes are saved to your profile.

### Using TTS

1. Click the "Enable" checkbox, or nothing will ever happen.
2. Click the "Auto-generation" checkbox if you want the TTS to start automatically every time a new message arrives in chat.
3. Optionally, click the megaphone icon inside the top-right of any message to playback on demand.
4. Click the lower right "Stop" button (found inside the wand menu) to stop any playback.

#### Voice Map

You must provide a voice map for the TTS to use, otherwise, it won't know what voices should be used for each character.

These must be in the exact format stated below:

`CharacterName:TTSVoice,CharacterName2:TTSVoice2`

For Coqui-TTS the format needs to include the speaker and language from the WebGUI:

`CharacterName:TTSVoice[speakerid][langid]`
 or
`Aqua:tts_models--multilingual--multi-dataset--your_tts\model_file.pth[2][1]`

#### Bark ZeroShot Voice Cloning Speakers

If using Bark you must create a voice folder with a voice file to clone. Ensure you add voices to homedir\tts\bark_v0\speakers\. On Windows it is probably C:\Users\USERACCOUNT\AppData\Local\tts\bark_v0\speakers\ type %appdata% in windows explorer then go UP a directory to local and you should see tts.

The directory should look like this:
- homedir
  - tts
    - bark_v0
      - speakers
        - customvoice1
          - speaker.wav
          - speaker.npz
        - robinwilliams
          - speaker.mp3
        - me
          - speaker.mp3

One first load of this model and voice bark will clone the voice and create a .npz file, this is needed for faster TTS.
