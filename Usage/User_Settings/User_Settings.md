## General Settings

These are the core settings that affect your overall SillyTavern experience.

### UI Language

SillyTavern's user interface is available in multiple languages. The language selector provides these options:
* **Default**: Uses your system language if available
* **English**: Forces English UI regardless of system settings
* Other languages available through the dropdown

Note: This setting only affects the user interface text. For AI conversation translation, please use the [Chat Translation](../../extensions/Translation.md) extension.

### Software Version

Your current version of SillyTavern is displayed in the top-right corner. This information is essential for:
* Troubleshooting problems
* Ensuring compatibility with extensions
* Determining if updates are available

To update SillyTavern to the latest version, please refer to the [Updating](/Installation/Updating) documentation.

### Account Management

Control your SillyTavern user account, back up your settings and user data, and manage user roles and permissions in [multi-user mode](/Administration/multi-user.md).

## Chat/Message Handling

### Message Display Settings

Controls how messages are loaded and displayed in the chat interface. These settings affect the overall chat experience and performance.
* **# Messages to Load**: Number of chat history messages to load before pagination (0 = All)
* **Streaming FPS**: Update speed of streamed text (5-100 FPS)
* **Example Messages Behavior**:
    - Gradual push-out
    - Always include examples
    - Never include examples

### Input & Response Controls

Settings that determine how messages are sent and how the AI continues its responses.
* **Enter to Send**: Choose between Disabled, Automatic (PC), or Enabled
* **"Send" to Continue**: Use Send button to continue AI responses
* **Quick "Continue" button**: Show button to extend AI's last message
* **Quick "Impersonate" button**: Show button for single-message character impersonation
* **Swipes**: Show arrow buttons for alternative AI responses (PC and mobile)
* **Gestures**: Enable swipe gestures for generation (Mobile only)

### Auto-Management

Automated features that help manage chat flow and content.
* **Auto-load Last Chat**: Automatically load the most recent chat on startup
* **Auto-scroll Chat**: Automatically scroll to newest messages
* **Auto-save Message Edits**: Save message edits without confirmation
* **Confirm message deletion**: Prompt before deleting messages
* **Auto-fix Markdown**: Automatically correct markdown formatting

#### Auto-swipe

Automatically reject and regenerate AI messages based on configurable criteria.
* **Enable Auto-swipe**: Master toggle for the auto-swipe function
* **Minimum generated message length**: Triggers an auto-swipe if the message is shorter than this value
* **Blacklisted words**: List of words that can trigger auto-swipe, separated by commas
* **Blacklisted word count to swipe**: Minimum number of blacklisted words that must be detected to trigger an auto-swipe

#### Auto-Continue

Automatically continues a response if the model stopped before reaching a certain length.

This lets your AI write a long response in multiple parts, so that you can have a short [response length setting](/Usage/Common-Settings.md#response-tokens) while still getting long replies. 

It will not make the AI write more than it would have otherwise. Asking the AI to continue a message that it considers "finished" does not usually work. See [How to make the AI write more?](/Usage/faq.md#how-to-make-the-ai-write-more) for other ideas.

* **Enable Auto-continue**: Master toggle for automatic continuation
* **Allow for Chat Completion APIs**: Enables auto-continue functionality for Chat Completion API endpoints
* **Target length (tokens)**: The desired message length in tokens - will trigger continue if message is shorter than this value (0-1024)

### Message Formatting & Display

Controls how messages are formatted and what content is displayed.
* **Forbid External Media**: Block embedded media from external domains
* **Show {\{char}}: in responses**: Retain character name prefix in responses if generated
* **Show {\{user}}: in responses**: Retain user name prefix in responses if generated
* **Show tags in responses**: Allow (some) HTML tags in responses to be displayed as HTML 
* **Relax message trim in Groups**: Allow AI to speak for other characters in group chats, rather than stopping the response generation
* **Show group chat queue**: Display response order in the character list for group chats
* **Pin greeting message styles**: Always render style tags from greetings, even if the message is unloaded due to lazy loading.

### Prompt Inspection and Debugging

* **Log prompts to console**: Output prompts to browser console
* **Request token probabilities**: Request token probabilities for AI responses from the API. Where available, these can be viewed in <i class="fa-solid fa-bars" title="Burger Menu icon"></i> [Token Probabilities](../../Usage/Chatting/index.md#token-probabilities-panel).

## STscript Settings

Configuration options for the [STscript parser](/For_Contributors/st-script.md#parser-flags).

### STRICT_ESCAPING

* Pipes don't need to be escaped in quoted values.
* A backslash in front of a symbol can be escaped to provide the literal backslash followed by the functional symbol.

See [Strict Escaping](/For_Contributors/st-script.md#strict-escaping) for more information.

### REPLACE_GETVAR

Helps to avoid double-substitutions when the variable values contain text that could be interpreted as macros.

See [Replace Variable Macros](/For_Contributors/st-script.md#replace-variable-macros) for more information.
