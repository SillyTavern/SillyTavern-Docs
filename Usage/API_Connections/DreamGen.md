## Models

DreamGen API offers several models of different sizes.

- Lucid Max (in API called `lucid-v1-max` or `lucid-v1-extra-large`)
- Lucid Base (in API called `lucid-v1-base` or `lucid-v1-medium`) -- corresponds to the weight-available [Lucid V1 Nemo](https://dreamgen.com/docs/models/lucid-v1/huggingface).

Lucid Base uses much less credits and is faster, while Lucid Max is more creative and is able to handle more complex instructions and narratives.

## Settings

The Lucid V1 DreamGen models use an extension of the Llama 3 chat template optimized for role-play and writing. They work best with a specific system prompt.

We strongly recommend to start with one of these master presets:

- Make sure that you have instruct mode enabled and select all checkboxes when importing.
- [DreamGen Lucid V1 Role-Play preset](https://dreamgen.com/docs/models/lucid-v1/sillytavern/master-preset/role-play)
- [DreamGen Lucid V1 Story preset](https://dreamgen.com/docs/models/lucid-v1/sillytavern/master-preset/story)

These presets come with built-in support for `/sys` to send instructions to the model. You can use those to steer the plot or control character's actions.

## FAQ

### How can I make the responses longer or shorter? 

You can set the `Last Assistant Prefix` in your formatting presets.

For long messages:

```
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The next message is from {{char}} and is at least 100 words long<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>writer character {{char}}<|end_header_id|>

```

For short messages:

```
<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The next message is from {{char}} and is at most 50 words long<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>writer character {{char}}<|end_header_id|>

```

Make sure to preserve all newlines, including the two at the end.

![Long Message Prefix](/static/dreamgen/dreamgen_st_long_response_prefix.png)

You can also include writing style description in your card or system prompt, e.g.:

```
## Style

<your description>
```

See the ["Style" documentation](https://v2.dreamgen.com/docs/scenario-editor#style) to learn more and see some examples. 

### How can I steer the role-play / story?

Use the `/sys` option to send instructions to the model. Some examples:

> The inkeeper offers Daria and the others a pint of ale. 

> The next message is from Draco and should be at least 200 words, focusing on his inner conflict about the decision.
