# Google Gemini

Gemini is Google's cutting-edge multimodal LLM, which is available though several APIs, including Google Vertex AI and Google AI Studio (formerly MakerSuite). This guide will help you set up the Gemini API connections in SillyTavern.

## Google Vertex AI

Vertex AI is a service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides access to various AI models, including the Gemini series.

There are several ways a Vertex AI API can be set up, and the available models may vary depending on the method used.

### Service Account

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) requires a service account to access Vertex AI, simple API keys will not work. A token will be generated from the service account JSON file, which will then be used to authenticate requests to the Vertex AI API.

You can create a service account by following these steps:

Prerequisites:

1. You must have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.
2. You must have a project created within your GCP account.
3. You must have billing enabled for that project.

#### Step 1: Enable the Vertex AI API

Before your key can work, the API must be enabled for your project.

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: <https://console.cloud.google.com/>
2. Make sure the correct project is selected in the top bar.
3. Navigate to the Vertex AI API page: <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com>
4. If it's not already enabled, click the "Enable" button.

#### Step 2: Create the Service Account

This is the identity that will be used to access the Vertex AI API.

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "Service Accounts" page. You can search for it in the top search bar or use this direct link: <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts>
2. Select your GCP project and click "+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT".
3. Service account name: Give it a descriptive name, like `my-vertex-ai-client`.
4. Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE".
5. Grant this service account access to project: In the "Role" dropdown, search for and select Vertex AI User. This role grants the necessary permissions to run models without giving away too much access.
6. Click "CONTINUE", and then click "DONE".

#### Step 3: Generate the JSON Key

This is the "password" file you need. It contains sensitive information, so don't share it or upload it anywhere public.

1. You should now be back on the Service Accounts list. Find the account you just created (e.g., sillytavern-vertex-ai).
2. Click the three-dot menu (â‹®) on the far right of that row and select "Manage keys".
3. Click "ADD KEY" -> "Create new key".
4. Ensure the Key type is set to JSON.
5. Click "CREATE".

A .json file will immediately be downloaded to your computer. Keep it safe, because this key can't be recovered if lost.

#### Step 4: Put the JSON Content into SillyTavern

The JSON file you downloaded contains all the information needed to authenticate with the Vertex AI API. It will look something like this:

```json
{
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "your-gcp-project-name",
    "private_key_id": "...",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
    "client_email": "sillytavern-vertex-ai@your-gcp-project-name.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
    "client_id": "...",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}
```

1. Open the .json file you just downloaded with a simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac, or VS Code).
2. Select all the text in the file (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A).
3. Copy the text to your clipboard (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).
4. In SillyTavern, go to the "API Connections" page, select "Chat Completion" as the API type, and then select "Google Vertex AI" from the dropdown menu. Switch the authentication method to "Service Account".
5. Paste the entire copied content into the "Service Account JSON Content" text box.
6. Click the "Validate JSON" button to make sure you copied it correctly.
7. Finally, scroll down and click "Connect" at the bottom of the API settings page.

You should now be able to use the Google Vertex AI API with SillyTavern.
