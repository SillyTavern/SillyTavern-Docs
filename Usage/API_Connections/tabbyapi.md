# TabbyAPI
A FastAPI based application that allows for generating text using an LLM using the Exllamav2 backend, with support for Exl2, GPTQ, and FP16 models.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI)

### Quickstart
1. Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/01.-Getting-Started) on the official TabbyAPI GitHub.
2. [Create your config.yml](https://github.com/theroyallab/tabbyAPI/wiki/02.-Server-options) to set your model path, default model, sequence length, etc. You can ignore most (if not all) of these settings if you want.
3. Launch TabbyAPI. If it worked, you should see something like this:

4. Under the Text Completion API in SillyTavern, select TabbyAPI.
5. Copy your API key from the TabbyAPI terminal into `Tabby API key` and make sure your `API URL` is correct (it should be `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default).

If you did everything correctly, you should see something like this in SillyTavern:

You can now chat using TabbyAPI!
