# Mancer

Mancer is a large language model inferencing service that lets you run whatever prompts you want and doesn't censor responses. Most of the models require a preloaded balance to start chatting, but there is a free model as of writing (2024-11-28).

You should now be able to chat with any Mancer model of your choice.

## Anonymous Logging

If you don't mind your chats potentially being used to train models, improve Mancer's service, publish datasets, or *whatever else* they may decide to do with it, you can opt-in to anonymous logging for a 25% token discount on select models. Simply go to your [Mancer dashboard](https://mancer.tech/dashboard.html) and tick `Enable Anon. Logging`.
