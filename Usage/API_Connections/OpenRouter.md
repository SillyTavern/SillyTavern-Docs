# OpenRouter

Don't want to sign up for a dozen API services, but still want access to all the latest models? Use OpenRouter.

OpenRouter works by letting you use a single endpoint to access models like DeepSeek, Claude, and Gemini, all in one service with a shared credit pool.

It has a free trial (about $1) and paid access afterward. No subscription or monthly bill - you pay for what you actually use. Some models have free access with a limited number of daily requests.

!!!tip
To get permanent access to free models with a generous daily limit, you need to buy at least $10 in credits **once**.

See more details on the [OpenRouter FAQ page](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq).
