# Quick Start

!!!light
I'm clueless. Just spoonfeed me the easiest and fastest way I can start using SillyTavern. -- *Anonymous*
!!!

You can get started with SillyTavern in just a few minutes. Here are two easy ways to get started:

* You can [use AI Horde](#quick-start-with-ai-horde) for free. AI Horde is a community-driven AI service that provides access to a variety of AI models.

* If you have an OpenAI account or want to register one, you can [use OpenAI](#quick-start-with-openai).

## Quick start with AI Horde

1. Follow the [Installation Guide](/Installation/index.md) to install and start SillyTavern.

2. In SillyTavern's onboarding screen, enter a name for your persona. This name will be used in the chat.
